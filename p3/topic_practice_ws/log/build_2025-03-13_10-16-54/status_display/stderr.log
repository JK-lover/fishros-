CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:24 (add_executable):
  Target "hello_qt" links to target "QT5::Widgets" but the target was not
  found.  Perhaps a find_package() call is missing for an IMPORTED target, or
  an ALIAS target is missing?


CMake Generate step failed.  Build files cannot be regenerated correctly.
